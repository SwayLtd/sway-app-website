            <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: Approximate device location (GPS or IP‑derived) collected only to

        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Purposes and Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
        <p>We process your personal data for the following purposes and on the respective legal bases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Management</strong> (Performance of the Contract): To create and maintain your Account.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Provision of Services</strong> (Performance of the Contract): To deliver and improve the
                Platform and related services.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Processing</strong> (Performance of the Contract): To process transactions using our
                payment provider.</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing and Communication</strong> (Consent/Legitimate Interest): To send you updates and
                promotional information. You may withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics and Improvement</strong> (Legitimate Interest): To analyze usage patterns and improve
                our services.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Compliance</strong> (Legal Obligation): To comply with our obligations under applicable
                laws.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing, Transfers, and Processors</h2>
        <p>We may share your personal data with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: Third parties that process data on our behalf, including Supabase,
                Google, Stripe, and Plausible.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Authorities</strong>: When required by law or necessary to protect our rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Partners</strong>: In aggregated or anonymized form for analytical and marketing
                purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your personal data may be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA) only if appropriate safeguards
            are in place, such as standard contractual clauses.</p>

        <!-- nouvelle section -->
        <h2>5. Account deletion and order history</h2>
        <p>When you delete your Sway account, all personal data linked to your profile
            (user table, follows, preferences, images, etc.) is permanently erased.
            However, European and Belgian accounting law (Code des Sociétés et des Associations,
            Art. III.86 §1 and Royal Decree of 12/09/1983) obliges us to keep transactional
            records for <strong>10 years</strong>. To comply with both the law and Article 17 §3 b of the GDPR,
            we keep order records but <strong>pseudonymise</strong> any personal identifiers
            (e.g., your user ID and email are replaced with an irreversible hash).
            These records can no longer be linked back to you by Sway.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected
            or as required by law. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accounting and tax-related data may be stored for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li>Other personal data may be retained for 5 years after your last interaction with the Platform.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Under applicable data protection laws, you have certain rights regarding your personal data. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access</strong>: Request a copy of your personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Rectification</strong>: Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
            <li><strong>Erasure</strong>: Request deletion of your personal data under certain conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Restriction</strong>: Request limitation of processing of your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Portability</strong>: Request transfer of your data in a structured, commonly used format.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Objection</strong>: Object to the processing of your personal data for specific purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Complaints</strong>: File a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe your data
                protection rights have been violated.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Security</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical, organizational, and physical measures to safeguard your personal data
            against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Despite these efforts, no method of
            transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal obligations.
            If material changes are made, we will notify you via the Platform or by email at least 15 days before the
